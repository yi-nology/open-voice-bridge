# Changelog

## 0.1.1 — 2026-11-10

Maintenance and quality baseline.

- Release automation: tag-triggered GitHub Release with linux amd64/arm64
  binaries, SHA-256 checksums and changelog-derived notes.
- Community baseline: issue forms, pull request template and Dependabot
  (Go modules + GitHub Actions, weekly).
- CI hardening: race detector and atomic coverage on the Linux test job,
  with a coverage artifact.
- Core tests: helper Unix-socket protocol (fake server), paste empty/Wayland
  paths, F24 watcher construction, and an `agent.finalize` regression suite
  driven by a fake ASR engine (dictionary, snippets, no-speech, short audio,
  errors and empty text).
